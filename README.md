Analysis of transcriptome data to understand how a mosquito responds to a microbiome transplant 

This code and data accompanies the manuscript "Aedes aegypti gut transcriptomes respond differently to microbiome transplants from field-caught or laboratory-reared mosquitoes" Currently deposited on biorxiv with doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.16.532926 If using please site accordingly, thanks!


Attached is an R markdown file, which takes a raw counts file from HiSat2 and sample metadata and from this conducts Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and generates associated plots.
